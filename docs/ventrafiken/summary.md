# Discussion
Crew training was conducted 2021-05-11. The fuel consumption of Uraniborg for trips between Landskrona and Ven have been analyzed for three periods: 

* black screens : measurements with no screen giving feedback to crew
* lit screens : a screen is giving feedback to crew
* training : crew training in eco driving 

The fuel consumption was 2% lower with lit screens compared to the reference period with black screens. The fuel consumption was 5% lower after training compared to black screens.
The average speed over ground (sog) was reduced 1% and 2 % during these periods at maintained trip time and distance. The reduced average speed is explained by changed speed profile during the trips as seen in {numref}`fig:mean_speed`. The top speed is lower but maintained for a longer time for lit screens and after training compared to black screens. This gives a lower average speed and fuel consumption. The differences are more pronounced in the Ven to Landskrona direction.

High correlation between the aft thruster consumption ratio $r_{aft}$ and the fuel consumption was observed. This means that the fuel consumption is often higher when the thrust allocation is 50-50%
between the aft and forward thruster, compared to when more of the thrust comes from the
aft thruster. Higher aft thruster utilization seems to coincide with lower fuel consumptions;
However, it is not possible to determine the causation, the cause and effect relationship between this utilization and the fuel consumption. It is not guarantied that an increased aft thruster utilization would reduce the fuel consumption, but it is definitely a possibility worthy of further investigations.

# Conclusion
Both feedback from the screens and training in eco driving reduced the fuel consumption. The largest reduction was achieved after the training. 

A possible relationship between high aft thruster utilization and reduced fuel consumption has been observed. An increased use of the aft thruster could be attempted to see if the fuel consumption is reduced. This could be conducted during the normal operation of the ship. A blinded experiment would be even better, in order to minimize the uncertainty from environmental disturbances from wind, waves, and currents. In this blinded experiment, the operation of the ship would be altered between two different crews in every other journey, where one crew operates the ship as normal and the other crew maximizes the aft thruster utilization.
