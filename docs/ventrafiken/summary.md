# Discussion
Crew training was conducted 2021-05-11. The fuel consumption of Uraniborg for trips between Landskrona and Ven have been analyzed for three periods: 

* black screens : measurements with no screen giving feedback to crew
* lit screens : a screen is giving feedback to crew
* training : crew training in eco driving 

The fuel consumption was 2% lower with lit screens compared to the reference period with black screens. The fuel consumption was 5% lower after training compared to black screens.
The average speed over ground (sog) was reduced 1% and 2 % during these periods at maintained trip time and distance. The reduced average speed is explained by changed speed profile during the trips as seen in {numref}`fig:mean_speed`. The top speed is lower but maintained for a longer time for lit screens and after training compared to black screens. This gives a lower average speed and fuel consumption. The differences are more pronounced in the Ven to Landskrona direction.

# Conclusion
Both feedback from the screens and training in eco driving reduced the fuel consumption. The largest reduction was achieved after the training.
