# Discussion
Crew training was conducted 2022-07-13. The fuel consumption of Vitaskär for trips between Norgersund and Hanö have been analyzed for three periods:

* before training
* after training at high season
* after training in low season

The mean fuel consumptions per trip are similar for these periods. There is a small tendency of a 1% reduction after training at high season. The fuel consumption for the period after training in low season is instead increased with 1% compared to the period before training. It is therefore not possible to conclude if there is a reduced fuel consumption after training.

Seasonal variations due to changes in traffic intensity and weather may have an impact that cannot be seen in this data. The operation of the ship is very consistent with small variations in average speed, course and, distance. The speed profile was compared for the three periods where only very small changes were observed. This indicates that there are very little changes in how the ship is operated after crew training. This could be because the ship is already operated in an optimal way. Futher investigations with alternative ways to operate this ship would be required to conclude this.

# Conclusion
Very little changes in how the ship is operated after crew training has been observed. The fuel consumption has not been reduced. There are small differences between the periods that could be due to seasonal variations or other random events.
