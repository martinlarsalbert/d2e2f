# Summary and conclusions
Crew training was conducted 2022-07-13. The fuel consumption of Vitaskär for trips between Norgersund and Hanö have been analyzed for three periods: before training, after training at high season and, after training in low season. The mean fuel consumptions per trip are very similar for these periods. No reduction of fuel consumption was observed after crew training. Seasonal variations due to changes in traffic intensity and weather may have an impact that cannot be seen in this data. The operation of the ship is very consistent with small variations in average speed, course and, distance. The speed profile was compared for the three periods where only very small changes were observed. This indicates that there are very little changes in how the ship is operated after crew training. This could be because the ship is already operated in an optimal way. Futher investigations with alternative ways to operate this ship would be required to conclude this.
