# Introduction
The operation of Vitaskär as seen in {numref}`fig:vitaskär` is investigated with historical data collected from the online [Blueflow](https://www.blueflow.se/) monitoring systems installed on the ships. This kind of analysis is important for the *Energy management* of ships: monitoring, analyzing and controlling. Only energy consumption that is related to the propulsion of the ships, the energy that moves the ships from A to B is analyzed. The energy consumption from the "hotel" of the ships is thereby not included in this analysis.
